The growing volume of digital data stimulates the adoption of
recommender systems in dierent socioeconomic domains, includ-
ing news industries. While news recommenders help consumers
deal with information overload and increase their engagement,
their use also raises an increasing number of societal concerns,
such as “Matthew eects”, “lter bubbles”, and the overall lack of
transparency. We argue that focusing on transparency for content-
providers is an under-explored avenue. As such, we designed a sim-
ulation framework called SIREN1 (SImulating Recommender Eects
in online News environments), that allows content providers to (i)
select and parameterize dierent recommenders and (ii) analyze
and visualize their eects with respect to two diversity metrics.
Taking the U.S. news media as a case study, we present an analy-
sis on the recommender eects with respect to long-tail novelty
and unexpectedness using SIREN. Our analysis oers a number of
interesting ndings, such as the similar potential of certain algorith-
mically simple (item-based k-Nearest Neighbour) and sophisticated
strategies (based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking) to increase
diversity over time. Overall, we argue that simulating the eects of
recommender systems can help content providers to make more
informed decisions when choosing algorithmic recommenders, and
as such can help mitigate the aforementioned societal concerns.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recommender systems play a vital role in dealing with the abun-
dance of online content available. In domains as diverse as e-commerce,
the music and lm industry, social media platforms and the news
media, recommender systems are deployed to help consumers deal
with an information overload by providing ltered and personal-
ized suggestions. At the same time, they help content providers to
increase user engagement/satisfaction and boost sales [48].
In line with broader concerns about the societal consequences
of digital technologies, such recommender systems are not without
criticism. While some scholars herald these as ways to bring niche
items to the attention of the wider public [44], others argue that
recommender systems mostly benet the already popular items by
recommending those even more [9, 39]. Recommender systems cre-
ate in this way what sociologist Merton [35] refers to as “Matthew
eects”: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. These concerns
about recommender systems reducing diversity have become par-
ticularly salient in the public domain where fears of an increasing
societal fragmentation, the so-called “echo chambers” [51] and “l-
ter bubbles” [45], are widespread. Moreover, as these recommender
systems operate by complex and opaque algorithms, they generally
suer from a lack of transparency [23] and user control [16].
To address these issues, this paper focuses on one particular do-
main where the use of recommender systems by content providers
play an important role, namely the news industry. Since recom-
menders predominantly deliver information that aligns with peo-
ple’s current interests and preferences, they can drive homogeneity
and could lower people’s chances to encounter dierent and not
yet discovered contents, opinions and viewpoints [2, 17]. Since the
media form an arena for public debate in which a diversity of voices
should be heard [15, 40], it would have detrimental consequences
to the functioning of our democracies [18, 50].
However, certain works argue that these concerns might have
the signs of a moral panic [5], since it is far from clear whether
recommender systems have such fragmenting eects. A growing
number of studies actually contend that these claims are exagger-
ated [38, 43, 62], since people actively gather and consume news
in many dierent contexts [54]. Moreover, it can be questioned
whether information specialization is necessarily detrimental to
democratic debates [17] or that exposure to a diversity of opinions
is by denition good for society [12, 58].
The point is that more empirical research is needed to assess the
eects of recommender systems. Analyzing their eects is how-
ever a complex task considering the resources needed to track user
behavior in dierent algorithmic regimes, not to mention the con-
sequent ethical concerns. In addition, online news consumption is
governed by a complex interaction between the users’ preferences,
the content provider’s intent (that translates to editorial priming),
and the webpage-nature of the medium.
This paper presents a synthetic alternative that, we argue, is nev-
ertheless able to shed light on these issues: a simulation frame-
work which allows for the visualization and analysis of the eects
of dierent recommenders systems. This simulation is based on
empirical data, and while a perfect correspondence to reality can-
not be guaranteed, such simulations do provide clear insights into
the tendencies recommender algorithms exhibit. Our simulation
draws mainly on the work of Fleder and Hosanagar who modeled
consumer behavior in an e-commerce context [8, 9]. To account for
the specicities of news consumption, we go beyond an exclusive
focus on recommendation and include both users preferences and
editorial priming as they interact in a news-webpage context.
We named our framework SIREN (SImulating Recommender Eects
in online News environments). It is open-source and enables content
providers to insert their own specications and to test dierent rec-
ommender systems deployed in dierent contexts. The adjustable
parameters of SIREN pertain to the items (articles), users (readers),
as well as the recommendation algorithms themselves, as seen in
Figure 1. SIREN currently allows for the evaluation with respect to
long-tail diversity and unexpectedness diversity metrics to address
the “Matthew” and lter-bubble eects respectively. By raising
awareness of the consequences of deploying dierent algorithms,
a concrete form of making algorithms more transparent, SIREN
allows content providers to test the eects of the recommendation
algorithms they have in mind with few resources.
In this work, we not only describe the design and implementa-
tion of SIREN (key contribution I ), but also consider a specic case
study—the U.S. news media—and evaluate the eect of dierent
recommender algorithms on long-tail diversity and unexpectedness
metrics (key contribution II ).
2 BACKGROUND
Algorithmic transparency is an important goal in today’s techno-
logically saturated world, especially as the workings of algorithm
systems are dicult to grasp for non-experts [13, 23]. Furthermore,
empirical analyses of algorithms typically require considerable re-
sources (time, data, eort and computational power), and do not
allow for the hypothetical testing of alternatives.
Simulations can be used as a means to analyze the consequences
of dierent recommender algorithms. If based on solid empirical
data and adequately parameterized, simulations can inform inter-
ested stakeholders about the eects of whatever algorithm they are
interested in testing. The outcomes of such simulations help those
who commission the implementation of recommender systems to
be better informed when deciding what algorithms to deploy for
the normative and/or commercial purposes they have in mind. In
the following sections we make a case for using a simulation, and
enumerate the requirements for this simulation.
2.1 Making the case for simulations
Simulations have been predominately used for evaluating and an-
alyzing algorithms with respect to dierent metrics (e.g., accu-
racy or diversity) and application-scenarios, such as e-commerce,
e-learning, personalized news and others.
In an e-commerce context, Fleder and Hosanagar [8, 9] propose a
simulation framework to evaluate recommenders in terms of sales
diversity. They propose a mathematical model of user behavior
that simulates user awareness, preferences and choice. A similar
work by Hinz and Eckert [19] focuses on the evaluation in terms of
video-on-demand consumption. Their model is based on economics
and marketing studies, but a number of parameters are calibrated
based on real-life sales data. Umeda et al. [55] focus on evaluating
collaborative ltering approaches. In contrast to other works, their
model incorporates the interaction among users.
In an e-learning context, Nadolski et al. [41] evaluate recom-
menders in a scenario where learners need to be advised about
the next learning activity to follow. Manouselis et al. [34] identify
the best collaborative ltering strategy for an online teachers com-
munity. Their work is based on a Web-based application [33] that
allows the creation of synthetic datasets, by arbitrarily dening
properties (e.g., the number of users). Sie et al. [49] use simulations
to investigate coalition recommendations i.e., advising users to
choose the right people to collaborate within a network.
In an online news context, Möller et al. [38] evaluate dierent rec-
ommender algorithms by focusing on the algorithms’ diversity with
respect to content-based features (e.g. topic or tone). In contrast
to previous simulation works, the authors generate recommenda-
tions based on a static snapshot of user data but do not specify a
mathematical model of user behavior.
At a more theoretical level, Lamprecht et al. [27] propose new
evaluation measures for the concepts of discoverability (helping
users to reach items) and navigability (helping users to explore a
collection). Navigability in particular, is measured by simulating the
user behavior, modeled through information seeking models where
users move from item to item using links, such as “related” movies
in a movie web-page. In order to investigate the relationship among
diversity metrics, Vargas [56] proposes a probabilistic model of user
behavior. The model considers diversity in the temporal domain
and incorporates a user browsing model i.e., the probability of a
recommended item being selected relates to its ranking position.
Despite the large amount of simulation works , we argue that
none of the listed simulation models can accommodate for the
particularities of news consumption in an online news environment.
The next section elaborates on the specicities of online news.
2.2 Requirements for the news context
In a news context, the simulation’s conceptual model should capture
the general mechanics of article publishing and consumption. At the
Figure 1: SIREN’s user interface: recommender settings, news article settings and user (i.e. news reader) settings can be adjusted
at will. The bottom row shows the generated visualizations for dierent metrics and dierent recommender algorithms.
same time, the model’s parameterization should accurately capture
the specic intent of both users and content providers, e.g., what
users want to read and what content providers want users to read.
Online news articles have a very distinctive nature that separates
them from other Web objects such as movies and music: Li et al. [30]
argue that typical recommendation strategies need to be adapted
to accommodate for a number of unique news-article characteris-
tics, such as their large volumes and short-term relevancy. Another
unique characteristic relates to the nature of the medium in which
articles typically reside. News articles do not exist in isolation but
appear within the website’s layout and overall content. Editorial
cues, such as position or font sizes, are frequently used to lead the
reading consumption [3, 29] and to adjust the salience of the recom-
mendations. The news-reading behavior is also unique, departing
from the typical “show me something interesting” attitude [6]. A
number of works [7, 53] suggest that besides the casual information
seekers, online news accommodate the needs of users with specic
preferences and interests. Finally, it has been suggested that those
user preferences are likely to evolve over time [30, 32]; and thus,
personalized news recommendations might have long-term eects.
We dene three requirements that a simulation model of online
news, with personalized recommendations, should satisfy in order
to adequately approximate reality: (1) users distribute their reading
time between prominent, sought out and recommended articles (2)
user preferences evolve (3) the prominence ranking of articles is
based on editorial cues such as their position on the news website.
3 SIREN
Based on the requirements identied above, we now present our
simulation framework, with a strong emphasis on the simulation
model, which takes Fleder’s and Hosanagar’s model (FH from now
on) of consumers and products as a starting point [8, 9].
FH considers a map of users (consumers) and items (products)
in an n-dimensional feature space. The product’s position describes
its properties, while the consumers’ position corresponds to their
ideal product. FH model uses such a two-dimensional space as its
simulation’s input for the sake of simplicity and visualization. Under
FH, items centered around the origin (0, 0) correspond to popular
items. At each iteration of the simulation, the users are aware of
items in their spatial proximity and popular items. In addition, at
each iteration, recommended items are permanently added to the
users’ awareness. For each user, FH decides the items they purchase
based on their distance to the user and an uncertainty component
that allows users to deviate from their personal preferences. After
a number of iterations, the simulation is complete, while the user
preferences and collection of items remain static throughout.
Similar to FH, our model assumes that there are |U| users (i.e.
readers) and |T | items (i.e. articles) placed in an 2-dimensional
attribute space,U,T ∈ R2. Each iteration of the simulation corre-
sponds to a news cycle (e.g., a day). Readers are aware of (i) articles
in their proximity, corresponding to preferred/sought out topics
(via search or navigation bars), (ii) promoted articles by the edi-
tors (as they appear on the news website), and (iii) personalized
recommended articles ∈ T (as they appear on the website, or via
email alerts sent to the reader). At each iteration, each user decides
to read a number of unique articles from those they are aware of.
At the end of each iteration, the users’ preferencesU are updated.
The article pool T and the personalized recommendations are also
updated at every iteration, while each article has a limited life-span.
Under this model, we identify three main interacting components
that SIREN’s interface gives content providers control over (cf.,
Figure 1): the articles (that translate to specic publishing habits),
the users (the readers’ preferences and reading behavior) and the
recommendations (articles promoted to each user). We now describe
the dierent components of our model in detail. We then present
the metrics which we visualize in SIREN’s interface. Finally, since
this model has been implemented in our framework we conclude
this section with a description of SIREN’s technology stack.
3.1 Articles
As previously discussed in Section 2.2, a successful simulation model
of online news consumption should consider the articles’ content
and article prominence.
3.1.1 Content. Under FH, the dimensions of the plane corre-
spond to arbitrary features. In our case, we decided for the articles
(products) and readers (consumers) to be placed in a content-driven
topic space, since getting online news is a deliberate experience
that may vary depending on the topic [36].
Typically, in marketing analyses where FH comes from, two-
dimensional product space is obtained by performing multivari-
ate analysis (e.g, PCA, t-SNE) on the high dimensional feature
space [59]. In order to generate a meaningful (yet generic enough
for any content provider to use) topic space for our framework,
we need a collection of articles that capture a common feature dis-
tribution among most current news outlets. We assume that this
requirement is largely satised by articles published by the major
U.K. media outlet BBC. As such, we use the BBC dataset which
contains 2225 documents corresponding to articles published on
BBC News from 2004 to 2005 [14]. Each story belongs to a topical
area (business, entertainment, politics, sports, tech). We represent
each document as a tf-idf vector and then use t-SNE to project the
high dimensional features into a two-dimensional plane (Figure 2).
3.1.2 Prominence. As previously discussed, each article has a
certain prominence that is largely decided by the news editors.
Under our model, each article tj ∈ T comes with a prominence
attribute zj ∈ [0, 1]. While zj might change over time (as it will
be discussed later) each article has an initial article-prominence
z0j . This is the extent to which editors promote an article on its
rst day of publication. Due to the lack of relevant literature, we
assume that z0j follows a long-tail distribution. Intuitively, only
few articles make the headlines; most of the articles are either
concentrated in the bottom of the webpage or are only accessible
through searching. At the same time, articles of dierent topics
are not promoted equally [21]. To address this, our framework
allows content providers to adjust the weights of each topic with
regard to their initial prominence. The weights are converted to
the Cumulative Distribution Function and each z0j value (ordered
from high to low) is assigned to a topic (without replacement).
With every news cycle, the old articles’ prominence is typically
adapted to make room for the new, e.g., by moving them lower
in the webpage’s layout. Our model accommodates for this fact
by adjusting the prominence zj at each iteration. The collective
eect of editorial cues and reader interest is that the readers’ in-
teraction with each article decreases with time, or as Chen et al.
[4] describe it: a news article is “a life form with stages of birth,
growth, decay and death”. A number of empirical works support
Figure 2: A scatter plot of the tf-idf feature vector for each
BBC article projected on two dimensions (our simulation’s
topic space), accompanied by the kernel density estimate
(KDE).
this observation. Mitchell et al. [37] report that roughly 80% and
90% of the interactions with an article happen within the rst two
and ve days of its publication respectively (exponential decrease).
Wang et al. [57] present a slightly dierent picture where the user
interest fades at a slower rate. For the sake of simplicity, our model
assumes that the prominence at the xth day of the article’s life is
modeled with a linear function: zxj = (−p x + 1) z0j , where p = 0.1
is the slope (i.e., a 10-iteration lifespan).
3.2 Users
We now focus on modeling the users, that is their preferences and
their behavior i.e., the process behind each user making a choice to
read one or more articles while taking into account the user-specic
requirements as described in section 2.2.
3.2.1 Preferences. As previously discussed both the articles’ con-
tent and the reader’s preferences i.e., ideal article, are represented
as points on the topic space (cf., Section 3.1.1). Under the FH model,
users’ preferences remain static no matter their purchase history. In
order to accommodate for evolving user-preferences, we introduce
a user-drift model. After reading article tj , a user’s likelihood to drift
towards the article’s position in the topic space is sampled from:
P(ui drifts towards tj ) = e−distance2i j /θ
∗
i (1)
where distancei j is the Euclidean distance from reader ui to article
tj . θ∗i controls the width of the bivariate normal around the ui user.
In practice, θ∗i controls the likelihood of the user drifting towards
distant articles. We sample θ∗i from a uniform distribution, reecting
the assumption that readers vary with respect to their eagerness to
evolve their reading preferences. The user covers m × distancei j
distance towards the article. We argue that m does not aect the
direction of simulation results, only the magnitude. However, a
relatively small m (e.g., 0.05) allows us to get a higher-resolution
view of the temporal dimension of the recommender eects.
3.2.2 User choice. Our model assumes that prior to any choice,
each reader is aware of a limited number w of articles per iteration.
In a scenario of no editorial priming, readers are only aware of the
items they seek out. In such a case, the reader-article awareness can
be a function of solely their spatial relationship on the topic space.
To accommodate for article-prominence, we adapt the original FH
model such that the user awareness is sampled from:
P(ui aware of tj ) = λθ ′log(1 − zj )−1 + (1 − λ)e−distance2i j /θ (2)
where λ controls the users’ balance between prominent (high lambda)
and neighboring (low lambda) articles that are modeled to be in a
user’s awareness. θ controls how the awareness fades in the reader’s
proximity i.e., the width of the bivariate normal around reader’s
position on the plane (the choice for normal distribution comes
from the original FH model). θ ′ controls how the awareness fades
with respect to the prominence dimension. We use a logarithmic
function for the prominence decay as it agrees with the general
long-tail pattern of user attention in news articles [26], i.e., how
the attention decays towards the bottom of a news webpage.
Fleder and Hosanagar adjust θ and θ ′ to create an “interpretable”
base case. In contrast, for a more realistic approximation of the user
awareness, we turn our attention to related empirical ndings. The
works of Tewksbury [52] and Mitchell et al. [36] indicate that each
user is aware of at least two topics. In our topic space, bounded
in [−1, 1], the Euclidean distance between any pair of BBC articles
follows a normal distribution (µ = 0.77, σ = 0.36). Setting θ to
0.07 creates an awareness radius of size ≈ 2σ around each user;
thus, articles of two dierent topics are highly likely (95%) to fall
into the user’s awareness. Considering that the contribution in
the awareness pool from reader’s proximity and editorial priming
should be inverse proportional under λ, allows us to set θ ′ to 0.5.
At each iteration the readers decide to read a number of arti-
cles from their awareness pool. FH uses a choice model based on
multinomial logit, a well-established practice in economics and
marketing according to the authors:
argmaxj ∈Wi
(vi j + ϵi j ) (3)
whereWi is the set of articles in the reader’s ui awareness pool and
vi j = −k loд(distancei j ) is the deterministic component (k to be
discussed later). The stochastic component ϵi j is an i.i.d. random
variable with extreme value distribution. Without the stochastic
component, the readers would always select to read the articles
closer to their preferences.
Variable k is crucial since it controls the uncertainty in the user’s
choice. The higher k , the less readers deviate from their original
preference-based article ranking, and thus the more likely they are
to select prominent or recommended articles. Fleder and Hosanagar
set k to 10. However, no studies support a specic k value for
an online news context. Nevertheless, according to the report of
Mitchell et al. [36] 28% of the news interactions with the user’s main
topic, happen while getting news on another topic. This roughly
implies that the readers should deviate from their main topic of
preference roughly one-third of the times. To set k according to
these ndings, we rst generate a set of 100 users placed on the
topic space uniformly. We then assign a “main” topic to each user
by using the class prediction of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
trained on the projected BBC articles. We additionally generate 500
articles using the aforementioned GMM. For dierent k values, we
then compute the choice (Eq. 3) for each user and count the articles
whose topic disagrees with the user’s main topic in the top ve
positions. We nd, that one-third of each user’s top ve articles are
of dierent topic than the user’s main for k ≈ 3.
3.3 Recommendations
In a typical news environment, the readers are recommended n arti-
cles (via emails alerts or the designated website element) at regular
time intervals or after they have interacted with a number of articles.
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the recommendations
are only updated at the beginning of each iteration.
The recommendations in our model have two eects. First, the
articles are added to the user’s personal awareness pool. While
under FH, this eect is permanent, in a news context that is rarely
the case considering the vast amount and short-term relevancy
of articles. As such, we assume that the awareness eect of the
recommendations holds for a single iteration. Secondly, assuming
that recommendations carry a certain prominence, the tj article’s
deterministic component as it relates to theui user increases:vi j′ =
vi j + δ , where δ corresponds to a “salience boost”.
However, not all recommended articles share the same promi-
nence: dierent spatial patterns can be used for arranging the rec-
ommendations. Our model aims to accommodate for that fact. For
simplifying purposes, similar to Vargas [56], we assume a list-based
arrangement and thus a positional-bias in the user choice i.e., a
rank-based likelihood of an article being selected. We take δ to be
a function of the article’s rank κ ∈ Z,0 in the recommendation list.
We use a simple exponential function, and as such δ ′ = δβκ−1 with
β = 0.9, following the approach in Vargas [56].
3.4 Metrics
While the simulation output can be analyzed from the point of
view of dierent research questions2, SIREN focuses on the concept
of diversity. In our work, we specically focus on two types of
diversity, long-tail diversity and unexpectedness further explained
below. While a number diversity metrics have appeared in the
literature over the years [25], we focus on the work of Vargas [56],
since it oers a direct mapping between our diversity concepts of
interest (long-tail, unexpectedness) to well-formulated metrics.
Long-tail diversity. In contrast to popularity-based recommenda-
tions, long-tail diversity focuses on recommending items which are
less popular and obvious choices [56]. In the context of news, the
possibility to integrate the long tail of topics has both commercial
and normative benets. In the former case, the under-presented
stories can be highlighted, thus providing a more stable distribution
of readers. In the latter case, it allows integrating into the public
agenda highly relevant topics which might be otherwise overlooked
[38]. To measure long-tail discovery, we use the Expected Popularity
Complement (EPC) metric. EPC is a user-oriented metric and takes
into account the items’ rank, relevance (whether the user selected
them) and overall popularity.
2In fact, SIREN allows content providers to download the full extent of the simulation
data and analyze it according to their needs.
Unexpectedness. Unlike long-tail diversity, which takes into ac-
count the interactions of all users with available content, unexpect-
edness diversity focuses on the individual user activity. This type
of diversity refers to the possibility of locating a story which is
unexpected, but still useful for the reader. The integration of unex-
pectedness in recommenders is known to increase user satisfaction
[20] and broaden user preferences by diversifying their interests
[24, 60]. From a normative point of view, unexpectedness is integral
for countering negative eects of over-tting, such as ideologi-
cal/topical isolation resulting from "lter bubbles"/"echo chambers"
[61]. For the unexpectedness diversity, we use the Expected Prole
Distance (EPD) metric, which besides rank and relevance, incorpo-
rates the content-based distance between items.
3.5 Technology Stack
We now describe turning the simulation model into a simulation
framework. The framework’s main variables and modules in addi-
tion to the interactions between them is shown in Figure 3.
SIREN’s implementation at each iteration takes as input the user
preferencesU, the articles’ content T and prominence zj and the
current reading history |U| × |T |. The user-awareness module (cf.
Figure 3,a) rst computes the awareness pool of each user from
the inputs. The recommended articles for each user are then com-
puted by passing the input to an external recommendation toolbox
(cf. Figure 3,b); thus allowing for further extendability. SIREN in-
tegrates the recommendation algorithms as they are provided by
the toolbox MyMediaLite3 [11]. The algorithms cover a wide range
of strategies, from the simple random, popular recommendations
to the more sophisticated collaborative (CF) and content-based ap-
proaches. After the recommended articles are integrated to the
users’ awareness, the user-choice module (cf. Figure 3,c) computes
the selected articles . Based on the users’ choice, the nal module
in the pipeline deals with the temporal adaptations (cf. Figure 3,d):
updating the user’s preferencesU and the articles’ prominence zj .
The simulation model of SIREN is implemented in Python and
is available online4.
4 CASE STUDY
SIREN allows content providers to instantiate the simulation with
parameters specic to their values, publishing habits and their read-
ers’ behavior. In order to showcase SIREN’s benets , we investigate
the recommender eects on a “default”, generic instantiation that
agrees with the major news outlets from the U.S., for which a large
amount of public data and studies are available. The instantiation
settings are summarized in Table 1. In the next sections, these
settings will be justied, followed by the analysis and results.
4.1 Articles
Our instantiation considers |T | articles to be sampled from a Gauss-
ian Mixture Model (GMM) of ve components tted on the overall
BBC document population (see section 3.1.1). As a reminder, we
consider the BBC-based topic space to be generic enough to agree
with most current news outlets, including our U.S. case study. Re-
garding the number of articles published per day i.e., the number

of articles available to the users per iteration, Bell et al. [1] reveal
that U.S. outlets publish articles at dierent rates, from 10 to 145
per day. We consider an average scenario of 100 articles per day
and as such |T | = 100 × d , where d the total amount of iterations.
With regard to the initial article prominence z0j , in order to realis-
tically distribute between topical areas, we turn our attention to the
News Coverage Dataset (NCI)5 comprising 3,200 topic-annotations
of the top-ve most prominent articles appearing in twelve major
U.S. online outlets, January to May 2012. The percentage of politics,
sports, business, entertainment and tech topic appearing in the
headlines is 85%, 3%, 7%, 5%, and 1% respectively. These percentages
translate to a distribution of the article-prominence across topics
via the process described in Section 3.1.2.
4.2 Users
We now turn our attention to the users/readers. We are interested in
active readers, that is, subscribed users that receive personalized rec-
ommendations and read more articles than casual readers. Similar
to Li et al. [31], we assume that a signicant preference-evolution
over time can happen only for active users. Our instantiation con-
siders the readers’ preferences, or position in the topic space, to
be sampled from a uniform distribution, thus assuming a scenario
where the readers’ interest as a group is spread evenly across the
topic space. Such a distribution captures a community of readers
unaected by recommender eects. Regarding the number of active
users |U|, while the amount of subscribed users for popular outlets
is known [42], the exact percentage of those who are genuinely
active is not supported by any literature. For the purposes of this
case study, we consider a scenario of 200 active readers daily.
We now focus on instantiating the reading behavior. According
to the Kaleida report6, casual readers are on average exposed to 16
articles per day. We can assume that active readers are exposed to
more articles, as such we set the maximum size of awareness w to

40. Regarding the awareness balance between sought out (neigh-
boring) and prominent articles λ (see Eq. 2), Fleder and Hosanagar,
supported by marketing studies on online purchasing behavior, set
it to 0.75. However, the report of Mitchell et al. [36] indicates that
an average of 22% and 35% of the articles are accessed through
search engines and news websites respectively7. Thus, 40% of the
total interactions, without recommendations, should happen due
to the user’s proximity to the article, and therefore λ = 0.6.
4.3 Recommendations
We now turn our attention to the recommender settings. While
the exact number n of recommended items varies from outlet to
outlet, we assume a generic scenario of n = 5. Regarding the rec-
ommender salience δ (see section 3.3) Mitchell et al. [36] indicate
that roughly 20% of the article interactions happen via email alerts,
which typically contain personalized recommendations (the extent
and type of which is unknown). The analysis of Kille et al. [22]
shows that roughly one out of 80 user-article interactions happen
due to in-article recommendations, but similarly, the recommenda-
tion strategy is unknown. We adjust δ according to Mitchel et al.,
as many of our model’s parameterizations are based on their report.
Given the current simulation instantiation, for all algorithms from
the MyMediaLite toolbox the average ratio of recommended reads
to the rest (sought out and prominent) is ≈ 0.2 for δ = 1.
4.4 Analysis setup
We ran the recommender systems simulations for d = 30 iterations,
as pilot experiments have indicated that it takes that amount of
iterations for the simulation to converge. In order to deal with the
cold-start problem, prior to the recommenders, we run a “control”
period of 30 iterations with the recommendations and user-drift
deactivated. We take the users’ reading history from the “control”
period as the initial input for the recommenders.
7The rest of the interactions happen via social media, email alerts etc.
Following on pilot experiments, we select to investigate ve
recommenders the exhibited interesting behavior: the Random and
MostPopular algorithms can be seen as baselines which recom-
mend random and most popular articles respectively. We also se-
lect two common collaborative ltering algorithms: ItemKNN and
UserKNN. The item-based k-nearest neighbor algorithm (ItemKNN)
recommends items from a set of k similar articles for each of the
articles that the user has read, while UserKNN recommends items
from the k most similar users (in terms of reading habits). We also
select a more sophisticated algorithm, WeightedBPRMF [10] which
is an extension of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) frame-
work [47] that aims to reduce the problem of learning to rank into
binary classication based on Bayesian analysis.
4.5 Results
Long-tail diversity (EPC). Figure 4 (left) presents the long-tail
diversity over the course of the simulation. Starting from the worst
performing algorithms, it is no surprise that MostPopular presents
the worst performance on long-tail diversity since it focuses on
popular items. Interestingly, the random recommender strategy is
only slightly better than MostPopular. While Random recommends
articles from the long-tail, the likelihood of users reading them is
small, thus the long-tail diversity is minimal.
The best performing algorithms are ItemKNN, and WeightedBPRMF.
It is interesting that the simple ItemKNN outperforms the more
sophisticated approach, although WeightedBPRMF eventually con-
verges to the same EPC diversity as the number of iterations/days
increases. The reason behind ItemKNN’s high performance becomes
more clear if we consider Figure 5; the position of users and articles
on the topic space throughout the simulation’s length. We observe
that neither ItemKNN nor Most Popular (that is used as a reference
in Figure 5) can prevent readers from concentrating around the
topical centers. However, ItemKNN generates small clusters of users
(circled in red on the gure) that are distributed across a topic,
Figure 4: Long-tail diversity (left) and unexpectedness diversity (right) over 30 simulation iterations measured using the EPC
and EPDmetrics respectively, for ve MyMediaLite algorithms (the error bars correspond to half the standard deviation for the
sake of visual clarity). The dotted lines correspond to the diversity of the algorithms over the same simulation but with the
user-drift deactivated (with no error bars for the sake of visual clarity).
thus allowing a wider range of the topic space to be explored. In
addition, if we observe the drift lines in the same gure, we can
see that ItemKNN demonstrates a greater degree of user drift, for
those users with preferences not completely covered by the article
selection i.e., users with initial position around the 1 radius.
Returning to Figure 4, another interesting case is UserKNN. We
observe that UserKNN gradually increases the long-tail diversity
until it converges close to the top-ranked algorithms. This behavior
relates to the fact that the user preferences evolve: the same simu-
lation run with the user-drift deactivated (dotted lines in Figure 4)
reveals that for static users , UserKNN fails to show a behavior of
increasing diversity. Intuitively, the more users are concentrated,
the more UserKNN can accurately identify similar users, which in
turn increases the likelihood of users reading a recommended item.
Unexpectedness diversity (EPD). We now turn our attention to
the unexpectedness diversity measured using the EPD metric (see
Figure 4, right). At rst sight, we observe the overall higher variance
of EPD compared to EPC i.e., for most algorithms users experience
unexpectedness at dierent levels. Looking closer, we observe a sim-
ilar behavior to the EPC metric: MostPopular and Random provide
the least diversity, while ItemKNN and WeightedBPRMF the most.
UserKNN starts at a diversity close to Random but eventually con-
verges to a value close to the top-ranked algorithms. Interestingly,
the unexpectedness seems to follow a downward slope for the top-
ranked algorithms and Random. This behavior again relates to the
evolving user preferences. A comparison with the diversity results
with the user-drift deactivated (dotted lines on the gure) strongly
indicate that the more users concentrate around the central topical
areas, the less unexpected the recommendations become.
4.6 Discussion
Our analysis provides some interesting insights. First, the overall
downward EPD slope and the increasing EPC diversity suggest that
the recommenders eects with respect to diversity are dependent on
the evolution of the readers’ preferences. While the temporal eect
has been already known for other contexts [28], our results suggest
that such eects may extend to online news. As such, studying
personalized news recommenders and their impact on the public
sphere demands a focus on their temporal behavior. Consequently,
we argue that studies based on snapshots of real-life data, e.g., [38],
can only provide a short-term understanding of the recommender
eects. Secondly, the overall dierence (with respect to both diver-
sity metrics) between the drift and non-drift simulations indicates
that evolving user preferences can be either benecial or unfavor-
able to certain recommendation strategies. For example, UserKNN is
certainly beneted, while Random and MostPopular are hindered.
Even if the immediate eects of the recommender system do
not lead to overall lack of diversity, our two discussion points
suggest that these eects can be inuenced by the users’ changing
preferences in a way that will have negative consequences for
the public sphere, such as societal polarization. This implies that
content-providers should aim to understand their users’ impulse to
change preferences prior to adopting any algorithm.
Finally, while the correspondence of the diversity metrics to
the user’s perception remains an active challenge [25], we observe
that common collaborative ltering algorithms, such as ItemKNN,
UserKNN, can be more or similarly diverse (both in terms of long-tail
and unexpectedness) to sophisticated alternatives i.e., WeightedBPRMF.
For ItemKNN, its relatively strong performance is not surprising con-
sidering that a number of works e.g., by Lathia et al. [28] or Park
et al. [46], already support it. The case of UserKNN, on the other
hand, is more surprising considering the lack of works supporting
its diversity potential and requires further investigation. Never-
theless, for content providers interested in oering a personalized
experience, while sensitive to societal challenges, such simple rec-
ommendation strategies can be valid candidates.

the simulation run with the default settings for two algorithms: ItemKNN (left) and MostPopular (right). The black lines track
the user preferences over time (a.k.a. the user-drift). The size of the articles corresponds to the amount of reads they received,
normalized by the sum of all reads. Their colors correspond to their topic label. For the ItemKNN case, for the sake of visual
inspection, a number of user clusters are circled in red. For the MostPopular case, the region of the ring with radius 1 (colored
in light blue) encapsulates a large number of users that failed to drift.
5 CONCLUSIONS
We proposed and developed an online news consumption simula-
tion framework SIREN, that visualizes and analyzes the eects of
recommender systems in order to help content providers decide bet-
ter what algorithms to deploy. In light of the widespread concerns
about the societal eects of curating algorithms, we argue that our
focus helping content providers be more aware of the eects of
dierent recommendation algorithms is an under-explored way to
mitigate their potentially nefarious eects.
Nevertheless, we should address the limitations of our approach.
Any simulation model is an approximation of reality which poten-
tially misrepresents the complexity of the phenomenon in question.
In our case, while evolving user preferences were considered, we
neglected the full complexity of editorial priming [3] and the tem-
poral news consumption patterns (week days vs. weekends) among
others. While our model is largely based on literature ndings,
certain components of reality were simplied while others were
modeled based on intuition. Yet our case study’s ndings conform
with previous work on diversity in recommender systems, giving
support to the reliability of our framework’s conceptual model.
Despite the limitations, our framework accounts for much of the
complexity of news consumption in an online environment. More-
over, its strength comes from its easy extendability and potential
integration of other features, such as dierent metrics and recom-
mendation algorithms. At the same time, SIREN allowed us to get a
glimpse into the recommender eects in the context of U.S. online
news and provided valuable insights, that would have remained
obscured otherwise e.g., the temporal dimension of diversity or the
diversity potential of common collaborative ltering techniques.
Finally, future research with SIREN should accommodate for
and explore the recommendation eects in dierent contexts, such
as dierent types of users. We are also planning to engage in a
discourse with content providers to further understand their needs
and particularities. SIREN will be regularly updated such that a
number of urgent research questions can be readily answered.
